<p>The segmented address space consists of a 16-bit segment value and an offset value.
These are used to calculate the virtual address.
In real mode, the 16-bit segmented value is multiplied by 16 and the offset value is added to it.
This is then truncated to fit the virtual address space limits.
The NEC V55 offers two special segment registers DS2 and DS3 whose values are multiplied by 256 instead of 16, providing access to a larger address space.
In protected mode, the 16-bit segment value provides an index for a table entry that contains the actual base address to be added to the offset value.
Long mode offers a similar scheme.</p>

<p>The virtual address space is remapped to physical addresses based on page table structures.
The virtual address is divided up into sequences of bits and each but the least significant portion is used to access an entry in a paging table.
This results in a physical page, and the last portion of the virtual address provides an offset within that page.
Most of these architectures provide various paging schemes, the first one available at introduction is included in this table.</p>

<p>While the virtual address space and physical address space have theoretical upper bounds, most of the time the implementation does not provide access to the entire address space.
In these cases, the table entry contains two lines, the first one containing the initial implementation, the second one the theoretical upper limit using the available schemes.</p>

<p>A handful of 8-bit processors are also included in the table for comparison and an overview of the evolution of address space sizes.</p>
